Let's start with a bold claim: **FAANG <u>technical interviews</u> don't actually test your coding skills**.

But before we get into that, let's talk about what FAANG companies are and the composition of their employees.

### What are FAANG companies nowadays?

Although the acronym doesn't hold much weight since it was coined by Jim Cramer in 2017, it still represents the most "prestigious" tech companies in the world. The ones that everyone wants to work at, the ones that pay the most, and the ones that have the most impact on the world.

They also employee a boatload of software engineers:

- Meta: >30k
- Amazon: >35k
- Google: >30k

How do they manage that many engineers you may ask? ~~Lots of middle management.~~ Well, they have a very well defined interview process that is designed to filter out anyone that _deviates from the baseline_. The process is so well defined that there are hundreds of books, courses, and websites dedicated to helping you pass the interview.

Given that Senior is considered a terminal level at these companies, it can be assumed that the majority of the engineers are at the junior and mid-level. This means that the majority of the engineers are not making decisions, but rather following orders and performing well-defined tasks assigned to them.

### Composition of the FAANG technical interview

Barring the design-related interviews, the technical interview is composed of the following:

1. A coding question with a known complexity and a known solution â€” also a very high probability it is a spin on one of the top 100 leetcode questions and [implements a well-known algorithm or data structure](https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/448285/List-of-questions-sorted-by-common-patterns).
2. An engineer that is there to answer question and quiz your ability to ask the right questions regarding the problem (space/time complexities.)
3. 40ish minutes to solve the problem and write the code on a whiteboard or a shared editor.

### What does this interview actually test?

Well for starters, for a large majority of candidates, it requires _months of preparation_ to pass the interview. This proves dedication and the ability to follow tasks and orders. It also proves that the candidate is willing to put in the work to get the job done.

Secondly, it requires the candidate to memorize and regurgitate information. This is a skill that is highly useful in large organizations that require a lot of documentation and process. Especially when it comes to institutional knowledge of tools that are created for internal-use only.

Lastly, they are predictable. With so many engineers to manage and assign tasks, it is important to have predictable processes that are standardized across the majority of levels. This allows for the engineers to be interchangeable and for the managers to be able to assign tasks to anyone.

Large companies do not want thinkers and innovators. They want people that grind out tasks and follow directions. They want people that are willing to put in the work to get the job done. They want people that are predictable and can be easily replaced.

> FAANG technical interviews truly assess your ability to follow instructions, memorize information, and perform similar (albeit repetitive) tasks.
