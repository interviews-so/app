<Callout>
  Although we sell technical interviews at
  [interviews.so](https://interviews.so), we strongly believe this is a better
  way to perform interviews. Even if you don’t use our material, you should try
  out this method for your next hire.
</Callout>

We’re tired of technical interviews that rely on puzzles for reliability. We want creative, **bold thinkers**.

We’re previous FAANG employees and startup founders and have interviewed hundreds of candidates. We’ve found some of our best candidates couldn’t do leetcode — and never would’ve passed at Big Tech — but were some of the most consistent problem solvers.

We found that collaborative, open-book interviews refuse to let strong founders fall through the cracks. Here’s how to replicate & implement it.

### Use open-ended problems with multiple solutions

- The candidate is presented with a problem that can be solved in many different ways but also given exact requirements to guide to a solution
- Having a base problem that gradually gets built upon is a good type of problem to present
- The proctor has questions to ask during pairing and tips on where to align with the candidate and steer them toward alternative implementations
- A general rubric ranging from performance to readability to eliminate subjectivity

### Pair programming

- Your proctor should work on the problem with the candidate, not just answer questions
- The candidate should share their screen with the interviewer, this way you can assess their daily work environment, general efficiency, and usage of tools
- The proctor and candidate should have a back-and-forth discussion of the problem, this isn’t a one-way street

### Usage of all resources

- Allowing the candidate to use all resources available to them including AI-assisted tools
- Allowing the use of all libraries but with the caveat they must explain their reasoning for why they chose that specific library

As long as your prompt is truly open-ended (no “find all the substrings in a string!”), AI won’t be able to derive complete answers. These types of prompts will inhibit the problem from being solved in a single pass without human instruction. Oftentimes, there’s a library that fits the niche of a specific problem domain, and this should be no different in an interview.

_Problems should be robust enough to encourage the candidate to throw everything they have at it._

Your next hire will be a core part of the team, and you need to know how they approach problems and tackle solutions. Treat your interviews as if this candidate was already on your team.
